# OOPS Task 03 — Abstraction (Java) (Easy Version)

## What is Abstraction?
Abstraction means:
- Show only important things.
- Hide unnecessary details.
- Focus on **what it does**, not **how it works**.

## How Java does abstraction?
Using:
1. **abstract class**
2. **abstract methods**

An abstract method has **no body**, child classes must implement it.

## What this simple program shows:
- Abstract class `Shape` → says every shape must calculate area.
- Child classes `Circle` and `Rectangle` → they implement the area logic.
- Main program creates shapes and prints area.

This is the simplest and clearest example of abstraction.
