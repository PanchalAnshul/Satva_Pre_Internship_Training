# Task 04 — Images

## Objective
Practice using images in HTML with accessibility and responsive techniques:
- Basic <img> and alt attribute
- srcset for high-DPI images
- <picture> element for art direction
- decorative images with empty alt
- native lazy-loading with loading="lazy"

## Files
- index.html
- images/sample.jpg (and optional variations sample@2x.jpg, sample-medium.jpg, sample-large.jpg, decorative.svg)

## Steps performed
1. Created `index.html` with multiple image examples.
2. Added an `images/` folder and placed sample images there.
3. Tested responsive behavior by resizing browser and using device emulation.
4. Verified network requests in DevTools.

```bash
git checkout -b html-task-04-images
git add HTML/04-images
git commit -m "HTML Task 04: Add images examples and README"
