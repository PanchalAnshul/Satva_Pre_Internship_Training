# Task 12 — Events

## Objective
Learn and practice:
- addEventListener for click, dblclick, mouseover, mouseout
- keyboard events: keydown
- form submit and preventing default behavior
- event delegation and bubbling/stopPropagation
- touch events for mobile
- event object inspection

## Files
- index.html
- app.js
- styles.css (optional)

## Steps I performed
1. Implemented click, dblclick, mouseover, and keyboard handlers.
2. Built a form submit handler using `preventDefault()`.
3. Used event delegation to handle dynamic list buttons.
4. Added touchstart/touchend handlers.
5. Tested event propagation and used `stopPropagation()` in delegated handler.
